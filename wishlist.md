# Wishlist

This is a list of features, tasks, etc. we want for this project/talk.
It should be considered under construction for the foreseeable future.

## Tim

- smart wrapper/decorator to run commands with sudo, but avoid showing
  password in logs
- Multi-line text pattern matching in tests - template? e.g. lsmod,
  check to see if my module is loaded, cat driver file and see register
  values

## Trevor

- Support for keystrokes in labgrid console to power cycle, other
  controls?
